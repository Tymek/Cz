# Messenger app chat in CSS

With Svelte and beautiful CSS.

Expected result:

<!-- TODO: insert gif of Messenger app with theme -->

Let's break it down into actionable steps.

### Fixed position

How to create a background with fixed position that is also clipped to the message bubble?
This is accually a bit tricky, because as far as I know it cannot be done without JavaScript.

<!-- TODO: illustration -->

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect

In Svelte my component looks something like this:

```xml
<script lang="ts">
	let ref: HTMLQuoteElement
	let top: number

	function loop() {
		top = ref.getBoundingClientRect().top
		requestAnimationFrame(loop)
	}

	onMount(loop)
</script>

<blockquote bind:this={ref} style={`--top:-${top || 0}px`}>
	<slot />
</blockquote>

<style>...</style>
```

## Glass effect

Css backdrop filter.

## Gradient

## Smoooth corners

There is an artifact near rounded corners when rendering our element... (screenshot)

I could use:

But it only works in Chrome/Edge/Opera at the time of writing. See _[Is Houdini ready yetâ€½](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/)_.

### Animate this!

## Summary

This is gorgous! &hellip;but it took a while.
And the lesson for all the managers, decision makers, designers and developers is: it takes time to create something applealing.
